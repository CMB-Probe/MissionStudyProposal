\subsubsection{Study Plan}

\vspace{-0.05in}

The mission study is open to the entire CMB community and includes more than 50 scientists. 
To gain maximum benefit from \planck , LiteBIRD, and CORE we invited international members to participate. 
The work is organized into Working Groups (WG) that represent each of the main themes of the study; see 
Figure~\ref{fig:management}. Working groups are led by members of the study's Executive Committee, 
as listed in the Figure. Although Figure~\ref{fig:management} suggests distinct boundaries between the 
WGs we expect and encourage significant overlap and feedback. It is not practical to enumerate all 
the interdependencies.

The study will be carried out through intra- and inter-WG teleconferences; mission design teleconference with JPL engineers; 
mission design meetings at JPL; and a community workshop that is described in more detail below under the `Space / Sub-Orbital 
Synergy' WG.  We now describe the planned work for each of the WG. \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Theory (Knox)} \hspace{0.1in} This WG will survey, summarize, and prioritize the set of 
science goals for the Probe.  Given input on target frequency bands, assumptions about foregrounds, 
instrument systematics, and instrument noise levels the group will generate forecasts for the impact of 
the Probe’s products and their significance to physics and astrophysics. This group 
will also investigate which other astrophysical data sets are most suitable for cross-correlation analysis 
with the Probe's data. \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Mission and connection with JPL (Lawrence)} \hspace{0.1in} The Mission WG is responsible 
for defining the overall mission architecture including telescope implementation, cooling, telemetry, mass, 
power, and cost. We are requesting that engineering and costing session be conducted with JPL. 
Charles Lawrence, Chief Scientist of the Astronomy, Physics, and Space Technology Directorate at JPL, and 
the \planck\ US PI, will lead this WG. \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Imager (Hanany) and Spectrometer (Kogut)} \hspace{0.1in} The imager and spectrometer WGs will 
translate the science goals to mission requirements and to nominal designs. The designs will include telescopes 
of various configurations, focal planes with several candidate detector technologies and readout schemes, optical 
elements, and cooling strategies. These groups will similarly consider 
the options for spectrometers.  Both groups will interact frequently with JPL
the Mission WG. The WG will consider an imager-only design, a spectrometer-only design, and
a combined instrument.  \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Technology (McMahon)} \hspace{0.1in} \comred{to be completed} \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Space / Sub-Orbital Synergy (Devlin, Jones)} \hspace{0.1in} By the time the \ac{CMB} probe is likely to fly,
significant advances will have been made on the ground. This is true regardless of the state of the proposed CMB-S4
effort, and even more so should funding for S4 becomes available soon. This WG will assess and recommend the 
most appropriate design parameters such that the data sets from the Probe and sub-orbital measurements complement each other. 
Pertinent questions include: to what extent should the aperture size of the Imaging Probe rely on delensing capabilities provided by 
high resolution measurements from the ground? What is the optimal resolution of a space-based mission from the point 
of view of providing foreground subtraction capabilities to sub-orbital missions? What is an optimal overlap in $\ell$-space
coverage? Does the design of a spectrometer depend on the specifics of data available from sub-orbital measurements? 
We are planning a community workshop to address these question, including forming a community consensus on the 
question of the need for a space mission if CMB-S4 is funded. \\
$\bullet$ {\bf Data Analysis and Exploitation (Pryke)} \hspace{0.1in}
The full sky nature, the broad frequency coverage, and the high  sensitivity of the CMB-Probe will generate a legacy data 
set surpassing that of \planck 's. This WG will plan for  the extraction of cosmological and astrophysical 
products from the Probe's data. This includes exploring optimal implementation of component separation techniques, 
of combining sub-orbital CMB data with the Probe's, and of cross-correlating with 
data at other wavelengths. The WG will assess whether specific synergies suggest preferring some mission parameter values 
over others. \\
%The group will also survey possible sources of systematic uncertainties that are introduced during 
%the analysis process and how these can be addressed during mission 
%design, implementation, and data analysis. 
$\bullet$ {\bf Systematics (Crill)} \hspace{0.1in} This WG plans to build an end-to-end simulation pipeline that will 
generate simulated measurements at an instrumental level, and feed them into the notional analysis pipeline, 
including foreground/CMB component separation and power spectral analysis.  With this simulation pipeline 
the WG will explore mitigation of systematic errors by design, for example implementing modulation 
schemes and modulator technologies, and mitigation of systematic errors by analysis techniques.  
This pipeline will be used to define requirements for a notional mission, and would be helpful in 
prioritizing the Probe's technology development needs. 

% To incorporate instrument systematics due to beams, bandpass mismatches, correlated noise, etc., time domain based simulations will be required.


$\bullet$ {\bf Foregrounds (Flauger) } \hspace{0.1in} High fidelity measurement and subtraction of foregrounds will permeate all aspects of the study plan. This WG will construct foregrounds models that encompass all the known and expected emission complexities. The models will be informed by physical inputs~\cite{draine_fraisse_2009,Draine:2012zu} and measurements, for example the spatial variations of the spectral dependence, decorrelation between frequencies, and departures from a simple modified black body law for Galactic dust~\cite{planck2015_x,planck2016_l,planck2016_xxix,Vansyngel:2016fbn}. 
The models will be inputs for the process of instrument optimization, tests of algorithms for foreground removal, and they will inform an optimal selection for the number of frequency bands, their central frequencies and bandwidths, all 
subject to the constraint of finite focal plane area. This optimization is also informed by choices of detector technology. 
To carry out exercises in foreground subtraction, we will implement a simulation pipeline that will test the efficiency of different component separation methods including Commander, SMICA, SEVEM and NILC, which have been 
used with the \planck\ data~\cite{planck2015_ix}. The WG will extract cosmological and astrophysical information from the component maps and their power spectra, and compare to the input values to assess the residual errors. 
% We will benefit from the experience of the \planck\ data including its use of specific power spectral and parameter estimation approaches (e.g. Master~\cite{}, XFaster~\cite{}, and CosmoMC~\cite{}). 

$\bullet$ {\bf Simulations (Borrill)} \hspace{0.1in} Simulations play critical roles in the design and development 
of the mission. To determine ultimate signal-to-noise ratio and to identify systematic biases we will build a simulation 
pipeline that is based on the massively parallel tools built for the Planck Full Focal Plane simulations \cite{plank2015_xii_focalplane}. 
We will take as inputs the characterization of the instrument and observations provided by the Mission and Systematics groups, 
and the model of the sky provided by the Foregrounds group. We will generate detector timestreams including 
sources of systematic effects such as frequency band mismatch, and detector noise correlations. Using candidate sky
scan patterns, the timestreams will be reduced to maps at each observing frequency. 
The maps will already include the effects of non-uniform sky coverage, and systematic effects such as 
intensity to polarization leakage due to gain and antenna pattern differences. The maps  - including both a 
fiducial dataset and supporting suites of Monte Carlo realizations - will be delivered to the Foregrounds, 
Data and Theory groups for analysis. To meet the computational requirements of generating and reducing 
these simulations we will use the HPC resources available to the CMB community at the DOE's National Energy 
Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center.

\subsubsection{Mission Study Timeline}

\vspace{-0.05in}

The study will be conducted in three broad phases with several months overlap to allow for the non-linear
nature of the progression: Mission Definition; Mission Implementation; Report Writeup. \\
{\bf Mission Definition: 3/2017 - 12/2017} \hspace{0.1in} The primary output of this period is a set of mission requirements that will feed into 
the Mission Implementation phase. To achieve a set of mission requirements we will adapt the \planck\ simulation pipeline
and use it to test the impact of mission parameters, such as aperture size, frequency bands, and scan strategy 
on the extraction of science deliverables. We will define the notional properties of the focal plane including the 
frequency coverage, angular resolution, and noise properties per detector; the specifications of the scanning strategy; and 
a model for sky emissions including the CMB and galactic foregrounds. We will then implement the mapmaking algorithm 
to generate multifrequency maps. This `mission performance engine' will establish a centerpiece of activity during the majority of Study period, not only 
during the initial phase, as iterations including progressively more complex foregrounds, and more systematic uncertainties 
will be used to validate mission design choices. 

During the middle of this period, in summer of 2017, we are planning to hold the community workshop. The goal for 
the workshop is to generate consensus about the complementarity between the data  from the space mission and from 
sub-orbital experiments. This consensus will inform the design parameters of the mission. \\
{\bf Mission Implementation: 9/2017 - 6/2018} \hspace{0.1in} This is the period 
This is the period during which baseline instrument parameters become a space mission. We will finalize the detector 
and readout technologies, or identify several acceptable options. We will investigate the impact of target telescope size 
and temperature on cooling resources, and cost. Readout technologies will also have impact on cooling resources -- because 
of the number of wires reaching the focal plane -- and on power budget. The preferred scan strategy has consequences on 
maneuvering the spacecraft and on attitude reconstruction. The large number of detectors will impose constraints on the 
telemetry. 

By the beginning of 2018 we will define a point design for the mission and a relevant exploration space around this design. 
The session with JPL's teamX is scheduled for 3/2018. This timing will allow for digesting the results and finalizing 
the mission implementation.  \\
{\bf Report Writeup: 3/2018 - 9/2018} \hspace{0.1in} Given the broad participation in this study we expect a number of 
iterations on the final report. Hence the relatively long time for this activity.

\subsubsection{Study Team}

\vspace{-0.05in}

The study consists of more than 50 scientists representing 
hundreds of years of experience with CMB theory, data analysis, and measurements on all platforms including satellite missions
that have already flown (COBE, WMAP, and \planck ) and the two proposed (LiteBIRD and CORE). 
The PI Hanany, who has more 
than 20 years of CMB ballooning experience, co-led MAXIMA and Archeops, was the PI of MAXIPOL and EBEX, and 
is a member of CORE's Executive Board, will have ultimate responsibility for the study. He 
is advised by a Steering Committee -- Bennett (Johns Hopkins), Dodelson (Chicago), and Page (Princeton) -- 
and assisted by a business office at the University 
of Minnesota.  An Executive Committee (EC) is in charge of the daily operation of the collaboration. The members
of the Steering and Executive Committees led and are leading operating CMB experiments that have 
produced the most compelling CMB 
polarization results. They include leaders and members of the WMAP, US \planck , US 
LiteBIRD, and US CORE teams. They include initiators and implementors of new millimeter-wave 
technologies, and of recognized experts in data analysis and theory.

%OVERVIEW of PLAN


%INSTRUMENTAL PARAMETERS:

%FG MODELLING:
% Planck Sky Model, PSM \ref{}, and/or  Python Sky model, PySm \ref{}, 


%TECHNIQUES:
% CMB4cast (http://portal.nersc.gov/project/mp107/index.html)). 

%SIMULATIONS
%For a more in depth analysis, that can also probe biases in the parameters, we will simulate maps of the CMB and Foreground emission at each frequency with CAMB and PSM (or PYSM) packages respectively and HEALpix modules \ref{}. Noise simulations will then be added to the signal maps. While white noise or anisotropic noise are straightforwardly simulated directly on map domain, 1/f or correlated noise requires simulating time ordered data according to a noise prescription or generator (eg akin to LevelS \ref{} used in Planck). The convolution of the simulated maps with the Gaussian beams can be performed straightforwardly with HEALpix modules, while the convolution with more realistic beams is harder but can be performed with approaches such as FEBeCOP \ref{}, developed for Planck data analysis. To apply the latter an optical beam and scanning strategy needs to be specified and adopted by the software.

%The next step is to clean the frequency maps from foregrounds and generate the 'clean' CMB map, using techniques such as Commander, SMICA, SEVEM and possibly NILC \ref{Planck2015-IX}. This is followed by estimation of auto and cross-correlation angular power spectra of the maps using say Master based \ref{}  or XFaster \ref{} based techniques and propagated to parameter estimation using CosmoMC or Multinest sampling. Along with this standard procedure we will also apply a novel technique based on direct Bayesian MCMC inference of cosmological parameters in the presence of foregrounds, without resorting to Likelihood approximations (an extension of the method presented in  \ref{Jewelletal2016}). 
%The latter will be integrated with Commander, allowing to bypass the angular power spectrum estimation as it samples Cosmological and Foregrounds parameters directly from the simulated maps. As in this approach the foreground parameter fits (including the spectral index) is performed pixel by pixel, the spatial variation of the spectral index is naturally accounted for. 

%As mentioned earlier 1/f or correlated noise requires simulating time ordered data. To analyse the resulting maps another ingredient is needed, the pixel-to-pixel noise correlation matrix. For a large number of pixels the estimation of this matrix is computationally intensive. As 1/f and correlated noise leaves mostly in the large angular scales and we resort to studying these effects on low resolution maps (reducing computational costs), hybridized with higher resolution maps for the white noise component. 

%It should be stressed that to fully assess the performance of a given instrument design, in view of both foreground residuals and the presence of systematics, realistic simulations are essential. These include time domain based simulations which can be generated using HPC4CMB ((https://github.com/hpc4cmb)) based on TOAST 
%(data framework, including on-the-fly simulation capabilities with full detector beam, bandpass and noise properties)), 
%and a destriper based map-making algorithm such as libMADAM. 


%FOM
%Finally to quantify performance we will need to define a figure of merit, FOM. Examples of possible FOM, are: the effective noise in the I,Q,U maps after foreground cleaning (effectively quantifying the noise degradation due to the presence of residual foregrounds); uncertainty and biases in the parameters; the evidence of the best fit model for each instrumental design (used as a qualifier of the instrumental design itself), etc.


%simulations
%While spectral domain forecasting can explore a wide range of instrument and observation parameter space, 

%detailed evaluation of prospective configurations requires explicit simulation of time domain data in order to capture effects due to scanning strategy (non-uniform sky converage, polarization resolution), beams (leakage due to beam mismatch, contamination from far side-lobes), detector bandpasses (bandpass mismatch including CO line contamination), intra- and inter-detector noise corrrelation, and more. However, the generation and analysis of time domain simulations is is a computationally challenging endeavour requiring significant High Performance Computing (HPC) resources to capture both the systematic and statistical uncertainties with the necessary precsion. 

%We will build on the massively parallel tools built for the Planck Full Focal Plane simulations \cite{Planck2015-XII}, now recast as the HPC4CMB toolkit \footnote{http://github.com/hpc4cmb} and similarly being used for the LiteBIRD and CORE satellite missions and the Simons Array, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 ground-based projects. 

%We will take as inputs the characterization of the instrument and observation provided by the Mission and Systematics groups, and the model of the sky provided by the Foregrounds group; generate explicit detector-by-detector timestreams, including all the necessary systematic effects, and reduce them to maps at each observing frequency; and deliver these map-sets - encompassing both a fiducial dataset and supporting suites of Monte Carlo realizations - to the Foregrounds, Data and Theory groups for analysis. To meet the computational requirements of generating and reducing these simulations we will use the HPC resources available to the CMB community at the DOE's National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center.
