\subsubsection{Systematic Errors}
% Brendan
Advances in detector technology since the formulation of Planck and WMAP will enable huge gains in raw sensitivity for a CMB probe. 
To fully take advantage of this sensitivity, systematic errors must be
controlled to detect polarization signals at nano-Kelvin levels. 
The proposed study will invest heavily in designing an instrument,
test plan, and observation strategy to address systematic errors,
gathering decades of experience of ground-, balloon-, and
space-based CMB polarimetry.  The latest analyses of Planck HFI and
LFI data in particular show the effects likely to be important to a
future space mission(https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02985).
These systematic errors can be considered in three broad categrories:
1. Intensity-to-polarization leakage, 2. stability, and
3. straylight. 
Each of these is considered in light of differential
polarimetery; the instantaneous signals measured by
polarization-sensitive detectors at different times and orientations are combined to recover
the maximum likelihood polarization signal from each point on the sky.

\textbf{Leakage.} The CMB temperature signal is many orders of magnitude larger than the
polarization B-mode signal (see, e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:clall}). 
 Therefore, instrumental mismatch effects that can leak
even a very small fraction of an intensity fluctuation into a spurious  polarization
signal must be addressed.  The main effects are relative gain and
bandpass calibration, differential pointing error, and differential beam
shapes.

Relative calibration requirements are likely to exceed those of
Planck, whose High Frequency Instrument achieved of order 0.01\% (cite
https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02985).  Bandpass mismatch between
polarized detectors gives an error in relative calibration when the
SED of the sky signal differs from that of the calibrator.  This gives
a spatial dependence to the leakage, potentially complicating the
component separation.

These systematics are likely to drive the instrumental
requirements on the optical system as well as the uniformity of the
bandpass of each polarimeter.  Calibration requirements will also be
set by limiting these systematics: particularly on the
knowledge of the polarization parameters (such as cross-polar leakage
and the angle of polarization sensitivity), as well as measurement of
the beam shape (in general a function of the SED of the observed source).
These systematic effects can potentially be mitigated by modulation of the sky signal in
such a way that allows complete reconstruction of the 
polarized sky signal using each photometer, for example, using a
half-wave plate.  

\textbf{Stability.}  Given the need to avoid light from the Sun,
Earth, and Moon, the full reconstruction of the polarized sky will
necessarily involve combination of measurements made at times
seperated by months, requiring stability of the response of the
instrument on corresponding time scales.  This systematic error puts
requirements on control of thermal drifts of spacecraft temperatures, to
mitigate thermal emissivity changes and thermoelastic deformation of
telescope structures.  The cryogenic operating
temperatures of detectors or reference calibration loads must be controlled
adequately as well.
Careful design of the scan strategy can shorten the time
scales needed for stringent stability, for example
Planck's scan strategy traced out great circles which overlapped on
1~minute timescales, giving a shorter effective time scale for
stability 
requirements. 

Additionally, the space radiation environment is modulated by the solar activity and
can introduce drifts in the cryogenic thermal environment as well as
introducing correlated transients in detectors and readout
electronics.  The design of the instrument must account this
environment, which following Planck is much better understood.

\textbf{Straylight.}   The brightest cm-wave and mm-wave sources in
the sky (such as the Sun, Moon, planets, and Galactic center) passing
into the far sidelobes of the telescope (defined as the response of a
detector from a source more than a few degrees from the optical axis)
in a sky-synchronous way can create a spurious polarization signal.
The far sidelobes can be reduced by optical design and baffling, but diffraction ensures that this
off-axis response will always be present at some level.  Measurement on
the ground can allow for some correction, and design of the scan
strategy can modulate the sidelobe pickup in a different way from the
true on-axis polarization signal, allowing its removal.
