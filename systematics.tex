\subsubsection{Systematic Errors}
% Brendan
Advances in detector technology since the formulation of Planck and WMAP will enable huge gains in raw sensitivity for a new CMB probe. To
fully take advantage of this sensitivity, systematic errors must be controlled to detect polarization signals at nano-Kelvin levels (roughly $10^{-8}$ of the background). 
This study will invest heavily in addressing these errors. 
We consider these systematic errors in three broad categrories: 1. Intensity-to-polarization leakage, 2. Stability, and 3. Straylight.

\begin{itemize}
\item Intensity-to-polarization leakage: Differential pointing,
  differential beams, gain errors, bandpass mismatch leakage
\item Stability: Thermal drifts, space radiation environment
\item Straylight: polarized far-sidelobe pickup
\end{itemize}
