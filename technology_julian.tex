The imager version of the probe consists of the following main technical elements: a telescope with an effective aperture size 
of $\lesssim1.5$~m, a focal plane consisting of thousands of detectors, coolers that provide a focal plane temperature between 0.1 and 0.3~K, 
and a multiplexed readout system with which a handful of wires are used to readout hundreds or thousands of detectors. Additional 
elements could include filters and potentially lenses and polarization modulators. 
The spectrometer version is also a cryogenic mission, and has two main elements: a spectrometer, and the cold load 
that provides its absolute calibration. Both versions have the standard complement of spacecraft bus features 
to provide pointing control and sensing, telemetry, and power. 

\planck, which was the last CMB imaging cryogenic mission, had 65 polarization sensitive detectors. The most significant advances since \planck~have been in developing detector and readout technologies, and optical components. The baseline imager, enjoying technologies of a decade ago, had $\sim$30 times the sensitivity of \planck. As the paragraphs below describe, a mission with today's technologies would already be 
more powerful than the baseline mission.  The CMB Probe promises to be orders of magnitude more sensitive than \planck.\\
{\bf Arrays of Detectors} \hspace{0.025in} Most modern sub-orbital experiments use TES bolometers, with thousands of detectors with TRL$\geq 5$. HEMT amplifiers, which are a competitive technology below 100~GHz, also have high TRL. The bolometric arrays have been successfully implemented with a variety of optical coupling schemes such as horns, contacting lenslets, and antenna arrays. Some instruments have deployed newer technology with arrays of `muti-chroic pixels'. With this technology several frequency bands are detected through the same focal plane pixel. As of now, arrays with up to 3 bands and 6 detectors per pixel are being used. A new detector technology using kinetic inductance inductors (KIDs) is emerging, which may have benefits in simplicity of fabrication and scalability to arrays with hundreds of thousands of elements.  \\
{\bf Readout }  \hspace{0.025in} Two families of readout technologies are in use: frequency- and time-domain multiplexing, FDM and TDM respectively.  Both offer $~64$ channels per readout module and have mature TRLs having been flown on balloon payloads. Increasing the multiplexing factor, a goal in both approaches, decreases the heat load due to wiring on the focal plane. The microwave FDM is an emerging technology which promises to incorporate $\simgt 500$ channels of TES detectors or KIDs per multiplexed module. It is attractive because there is no dissipation at the coldest stage, but there is increased dissipation at $\sim 4$~K and further development is required to reduce the ambient temperature power consumption.  Currently the ambient temperature power consumption of TDM systems is $\times2-3$ lower, but development is necessary to reduce the higher power consumption at the coldest stage. \\
{\bf Polarization Modulators and Other Optical Components}  \hspace{0.025in} A polarization modulator presents an attractive means to reject a host of systematic uncertainties. Some sub-orbital experiments have used modulators and experience with their operation, efficacy, and the systematic errors they present, is growing. For use with the Probe, the modulators will need to have high polarization efficiency over a broad bandwidth.  A fractional bandwidth of $\sim$100\% has been demonstrated. Optical systems that incorporate refractive elements can realize higher throughput than reflectors alone; the use of refractors -- or a modulator -- requires broad-band anti-reflection coatings. Groups have developed specialized sprays and techniques to fabricate sub-wavelength structures. Most of these technologies have TRL$\geq$5.  \\
{\bf Spectrometer} \hspace{0.025in} The polarizing Fourier transform spectrometer builds on the COBE/FIRAS mission using mature technology with TRL $\geq$6. The baseline spectrometer we have assumed here is comprised of a number of individual spectrometers, each with its own absolute reference calibrator. Multi-moded optics, concentrators, detectors, and calibrators have been demonstrated. The detector readout is copied from the 
that used for the Hitomi mission, but the Probe version may combine multiple spectrometer beams within a single telescope. 
How to achieve that will be part of this study. \\
{\bf Cryogenics }  \hspace{0.0025in} For providing an operating temperature of 0.1~K: an open cycle dilution refrigerator, a European technology, was flown on \planck. A closed cycle version is under development (also in Europe) and has TRL 3-4. A Goddard continuous adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) will soon be flown on a balloon payload. The Hitomi spacecraft operated a staged version of such an ADR. For higher operating temperatures, refrigerator technologies are standard, but suitability for the mission thermal loads will be assessed during the study. \\
{\bf High Performance Computing} \hspace{0.0025in} Due to its volume, the simulation or time-ordered data and its reduction to maps requires massively parallel software running on state-of-the-art supercomputers. The current code base runs efficiently at scale on existing HPC systems, but porting and optimizing for the next generation(s) of energy-constrained supercomputers - such as the Xeon Phi based Cray XC40 being installed at NERSC now - will be a major challenge to be studied.
