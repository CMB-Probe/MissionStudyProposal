Future space-borne studies of the CMB spectrum open a new window to early phases of the Universe ($z > 10^3$), 
which cannot be probed in any other way. This yet unexplored tool for testing the standard cosmological paradigm 
including inflation and reionization, 
as well as a host of non-standard physical mechanisms, such as decaying an annihilating particles, 
can {\it only} be exploited with a satellite mission.
