\subsubsection{Current and Forthcoming Sub-Orbital Efforts}

The remarkable forthcoming scientific yield has motivated significant agency investments 
in current and future sub-orbital experiments which are designed to realize the full potential of this
unique probe of fundamental physics and astrophysics.    These experiments are designed 
to exploit the comparative advantages of the sub-orbital platforms, while providing the design heritage and 
experience necessary to maximize the probability of success of an orbital mission. 

For the ground-based efforts, these include combinations of {\it i)}
provision for large apertures and therefore high angular
resolution, {\it ii)} extremely long observation times, {\it iii)}
flexibility to rapidly deploy new technologies, and {\it iv)}
allowance for detector formats that are relatively unconstrained by
mass and power limitations.  In aggregate, these have demonstrated low
noise measurements of small and intermediate angular scale $E$ polarization 
structures over areas of up to 10\% of the sky \comred{(check)}. The largest sky fraction 
over which $B$ mode has been measured to date is ??\%. 

The balloon-borne missions {\it i)} extend the frequency reach of the ground based telescopes, 
{\it ii)} enable high fidelity measurements on larger angular scales than can be probed from the 
ground, and {\it iii)} grant inexpensive access to a space-like environment, providing heritage 
for future space missions as well as experience in dealing with the analysis of data that 
are representative of a space mission.In this way, the sub-orbital programs complement and 
multiply the scientific return of the proposed orbital mission, while reinforcing its technical 
preparedness.  

The 2010 Decadal Panel strongly recommended supporting sub-orbital efforts in preparation 
for a possible space mission to follow sub-orbital detections of inflationary gravity waves. 
As a result, the US has clear leadership in the field, both in terms of ground- and balloon-based 
experiments and results. 

This leadership will continue into the foreseeable future. In aggregate, funded, now-being-built `Stage 3' 
CMB experiments will deploy approximately 50,000 detectors on various sub-orbital experiments 
within the next 3-5 years. 
Ground-based experiments plan to extend measurements from few percent of the sky to few tens, 
although in a limited frequency range between 30 and 300~GHz. Balloon-borne 
payloads operating at even higher frequencies strive to cover even larger fractions.  

%As a result, noise levels will decrease, the foregrounds will progressively be better understood, 
%technologies will be tested, and we will have learned how to 

%Some funded ground-based efforts now being under construction or commissioning, are expected 
%to reach noise levels of ?? $\mu$ K arcmin over ??\% of the sky, in a limited frequency 
%range, between 90 and 280~GHz, and after ?? years of integration.

\subsubsection{Proposed Efforts: LiteBIRD, CORE, and CMB-S4} 

\vspace{-0.05in}

Japan, in collaboration with NASA, is now considering whether to proceed with LiteBIRD, a space mission 
designed to search for $B$-modes from inflation. The US Team has submitted its Phase A report to NASA; Phase A 
in Japan will conclude in about a year \comred{check}. LiteBIRD is a smaller, more focused
mission compared to the CMB Probe. It is an imager based on a 0.5~m aperture 
telescope. Therefore it has a resolution 4 times lower compared to the 2~m aperture EPIC-IM. Its
reach in $\ell$ space is correspondingly 4 times lower making the science available at $\ell$'s above 
few hundred in both $E$ and $B$ modes unreachable. 
It has no spectroscopic capabilities and thus not sensitive to any of the spectral distortion science goals. 

For the Japanese space agency JAXA, LiteBIRD is meant to fit within a cap of \$350M \comred{check}. 
Although there are uncertainties about comparing JAXA's cost calculations to NASA's, LiteBIRD's overall size 
and more limited science reach is commensurate with it being below, or just at the lower margin of the Probe 
financial scope. 

A collaboration of scientists in Europe has just recently proposed CORE to ESA as part of the M5 round 
of space mission proposals. 
The team includes a number of US collaborators; the PI of this proposal is a member of 
CORE's executive board \comred{check}. CORE is a CMB polarization imager that is based on a 
1.2~m aperture telescope and thus intended to reach 2.5 times the resolution of LiteBIRD. ESA has 
capped the M5 proposals to EU550M, the equivalent of 
\$610M. Member countries are expected to contribute an additional $\sim$\$100M making the total 
cost close to \$700M. Selection of missions for Phase A studies is expected in fall 2017, and 
end of Phase A selection in fall 2019. 

The US CMB community has proposed, and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) has recommended 
to the DOE, the establishment of a 4th generation CMB experiment called CMB-S4. This is an ambitious 
program to field 10 times the number of detectors fielded by Stage 3 experiments. If and when funded 
CMB-S4 will enable unprecedented sensitivity at frequency bands accessible from the ground, and 
with telescopes that enable high resolution. 

%A robust program of sub-orbital experimentation has proven a vital component in the success of all three generations of previous CMB orbital missions -- COBE, WMAP and {\it Planck}. Building on this heritage, the current (Stage-3) and planned (Stage-4) sub-orbital experiments are well poised to play a similar role for the CMB Probe, which will provide definitive measurements of the full sky from the largest angular scales to the $5^\prime$ scale of the beam.

\subsubsection{Why Study a CMB Probe?} 

\vspace{-0.05in}

Learning from the successes of COBE/FIRAS, COBE/DMR, WMAP, and \planck, a
CMB Probe is the single most suitable vehicle to deliver complete sky coverage 
and therefore information on the largest angular scales, 
comprehensive frequency coverage, and exquisite control of systematic effects. 
The mission will provide a single self-consistent and self-calibrated data set. It 
will provide legacy maps at many frequency bands that will become the basis for 
hundreds of new contributions to science. We should consider launching this mission to 
reach all the science goals described 
in Section~\ref{sec:mission}. Some of the science goals are not reachable
from ground-based observatories, or make take many years to achieve.   
If the Inflationary signal is detected by sub-orbital experiments
any time soon, a space mission to characterize the signal in full detail is equally compelling. 
The existence of ambitious sub-orbital programs is a complementary strength. How 
to make the best use of this complementarity is an explicit goal of our study; 
see Section{sec:management}.
