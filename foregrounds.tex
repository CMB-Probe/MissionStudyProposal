\subsection{The Challenges: Foregrounds and Systematics}
\label{sec:foregrounds_systematics}

\vspace{-0.05in}
The search for primordial B-modes sets the most stringent requirements on foreground removal and control of systematic effects. A tentative target for the CMB Probe is to constrain the tensor to scalar ratio with an 
uncertainty that is a factor of 100 smaller than the current upper limit \mbox{$r < 0.07$}, that is, to reach 
$\sigma(r) <0.0007$. According to data from \planck\ and 
sub-orbital experiments foregrounds currently already dominate the signal. A 100-fold improvement 
on the final error will require exquisite measurement and accounting for foreground sources 
of confusion. 

To ascertain that the Probe's uncertainty on the measurement of $r$ is dominated by statistic rather than 
systematic error, the mission's design, execution, and data analysis will have to be dominated by the need
to controlling systematic uncertainties to an unprecedented, and certainly not yet achieved, levels.

Whereas the CMB temperature anisotropy signal dominates galactic sources
of emission over much of the sky, this is not the case for polarization. 
Figure~\ref{fig:frequency} compares the expected RMS brightness temperature 
of polarized emission from galactic sources to the level of $E$ and $B$ mode signals
as a function of frequency and gives the expected signal levels as a function of angular scale $\ell$.

\noindent The conclusions, some of which are also borne out by \planck\ measurements, are that: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item{over the largest angular scales (lowest $\ell$s), which are crucial for a range 
of science goals and where an inflationary $B$ mode 
signal would be largest relative to that from lensing and instrument noise, foreground sources of confusion will need to be measured and subtracted to a level better than 1 part in 10 for $E$ and in 100 for $B$;}
\item{foregrounds dominate the potential inflationary $B$ mode signal on {\it all} angular scales by an order of magnitude or more.}
\end{itemize}

Known signals can be accounted for and removed with multi-frequency observations even if their amplitude is large. 
But the best measurements to date, from \planck , fall far shorter than needed for the fidelity 
envisioned for the Probe. This is visually demonstrated by Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001}, which 
compares the level of $B$ mode signal at low $\ell$ for $r = 0.001$ to the \planck\ 353 GHz noise, 
extrapolated to 150~GHz, a frequency band in which the signal is among the strongest.

Removal of foregrounds based on multi-frequency data in a number of frequency bands relies on extrapolations between frequencies based on an assumed spectral dependence. At the current precision a power law dependence for synchrotron radiation and a modified black body spectrum for dust provide a reasonable fit to CMB data. At the level of precision required for a probe mission, this description will no longer be sufficient. The complex composition of dust leads to departures from a simple modified black body spectrum because different components may emit at different temperatures. The different components are in general not be perfectly correlated with each other, leading to decorrelation between frequency bands. Furthermore, the spectral dependence of synchrotron and dust emission is spatially varying. The spectral dependence must ultimately be measured with the probe mission. The challenge is to design the frequency coverage to do so optimally.  

While the search for primordial B-modes leads to the strictest constraints on foreground residuals, exquisite control of foregrounds is also necessary for the other science objectives. The critical measurements of $\tau$, available by a cosmic variance limited measurement of the $E$ power spectrum, are buried below the foregrounds at $\ell < 10$. In addition, one must understand the foreground requirements to successfully delens the data at the required level.
Recovering {\it all} of the spectral distortions signals from the raw data will require proper accounting 
for emission by dust grains, synchrotron emission from electrons spiraling in the galactic magnetic 
field, and Coulomb scattering of charged particles (`free-free'); see Figure~\ref{fig:distortions}.   


%will be buried below the A satellite mission is likely also the only reliable way to measure the optical depth at a level necessary to break the degeneracy with the neutrino mass. 

%Nor is it clear that any set of sub-orbital measurements would provide a path for measuring 
%the foregrounds to the fidelity anticipated because the atmosphere limits the frequency 
%bands accessible, and because sub-orbital measurements are less stable and more prone
%to systematic uncertainties.  

% A mission aiming to detect primordial $B$-modes at this level across the sky will therefore not be able to rely on existing data. High signal-to-noise foreground measurements must accompany those at frequencies where the CMB contribution is larger.  As discussed below, optimizing the frequency coverage of these measurements will be a key goal of the mission concept study.

% \emph{Even in the cleanest patches of the sky}, polarized foreground emission is brighter than the sought-after primordial $B$-mode signal by over an order of magnitude at all frequencies.  This statement holds at all angular scales relevant to the search for primordial $B$-modes, as shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:frequency}.

%A satellite mission provides a unique opportunity to target both the inflationary B-mode polarization that originates from the epoch of recombination and peaks around $\ell=80$ and the contribution that peaks on significantly larger scales $\ell\lesssim 12$. To measure the contribution from reionization will require an unprecedented understanding of foregrounds and systematic effects. This is illustrated in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001}, which shows the contribution from reionization to the Stokes $Q$-parameter for $r=0.001$. The amplitude of the signal is approximately $10$ nK

%A satellite experiment enables
%full-sky observations, and provides 

%The CMB Probe has complete flexibility in the choice of frequency coverage, both of which are challenging from the ground or from the balloon platform.  Among other limitations, the atmosphere prevents observations at key frequencies, such as 60\,GHz, and requires data filtering that makes it difficult to recover the larger angular scales.

%By the time a probe-class mission launches, substantial progress will have been made in this quest.  In the absence of a primordial $B$-mode signal at detectable levels, the mission will significantly improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, with $\sigma(r)\!\sim\!10^{-3}$.  However, if $r$ is large enough, tentative $B$-mode detections could be reported from the ground or by ballon experiments ahead of this mission. The significance of such a discovery would be such that the detailed characterization of the angular and spectral dependence of the signal, as well as the verification of its isotropy across the sky, both of which are uniquely enabled by a satellite mission, would be required to confirm its primordial origin \comred{(cite Decadal Survey)}.

%In this scenario, a probe-class mission will in particular detect and characterize the reionization signal expected at the largest angular scales (multipoles below $\sim\!10$), where observations from other platforms are the most challenging. The contribution from reionization to the Stokes parameter $Q$ for $r=0.001$ is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001}. The amplitude of this signal is $\sim\!10$\,nK, which requires that any experiment attempting to measure it control large-scale foregrounds and systematics at the unprecedented level of a few nK.
