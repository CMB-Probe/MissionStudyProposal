%A satellite mission provides a unique opportunity to target both the inflationary B-mode polarization that originates from the epoch of recombination and peaks around $\ell=80$ and the contribution that peaks on significantly larger scales $\ell\lesssim 12$. To measure the contribution from reionization will require an unprecedented understanding of foregrounds and systematic effects. This is illustrated in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001}, which shows the contribution from reionization to the Stokes $Q$-parameter for $r=0.001$. The amplitude of the signal is approximately $10$ nK

The search for primordial B-modes is one of the main science objectives of any future CMB mission. A satellite mission is the most sensitive probe of this signal from the early universe because it can access the full sky and the choice of frequencies is not limited by the atmosphere. 

By the time of launch of a probe class mission substantial progress will already have been made. In the case of a detection at the time of launch, the probe mission should be able to convincingly detect the expected reionization signal. In the absence of a signal it should significantly improve the upper limits beyond $\sigma(r)=0.001$. 

The contribution from reionization to the Stokes $Q$-parameter for a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$ is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001}. The amplitude of the signal is approximately $10$ nK so that any experiment attempting to measure such a signal must control foregrounds and systematics on large angular scales at an unprecedented level of a few nK.

\subsubsection{Foregrounds}
Data from the $Planck$ satellite has significantly improved our understanding of foregrounds in both intensity and polarization. 
%In intensity, $Planck$, for example, showed the unexpected relevance of Carbon-Monoxide lines at moderate latitudes as well as the existence of an anomalous emission from dust at low frequencies. 
In polarization, the sky is dominated by the expected sources, synchrotron and dust, and $Planck$ has provided us with much improved measurements of their amplitude and spectral dependence. The observed spectral dependence is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:frequency} for different sky fractions. One of the most important lessons is that foregrounds are larger than putative primordial B-mode signal everywhere. 



This is particularly severe on the scales relevant for the search of primordial B-modes as can be seen in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:frequency}, which shows the power spectrum of foregrounds over $75\%$ of the sky for frequencies between $70$ and $200$ GHz together with the lensing and inflationary contribution for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

Perfect knowledge of the foreground components would allow to remove them, but the sensitivity of Planck limits our ability. The right panel in Figure~\ref{fig:Qrp001} shows the noise in the $Planck$ 353 GHz map of the Stokes $Q$-parameter rescaled to 150 GHz assuming the same spectral dependence as for dust and on the angular scales relevant for the measurement of the inflationary $B$-modes. The noise is more than an order of magnitude larger than the inflationary contribution for $r=0.001$, clearly indicating the necessity to measure foregrounds with a potential future space mission. A probe class mission likely is the only way to map foregrounds at a level required to measure primordial gravitational waves for $r<0.001$. 

A satellite mission is likely also the only reliable way to measure the optical depth at a level necessary to break the degeneracy with the neutrino mass. Furthermore, a cosmic variance limited measurement of E-mode polarization on large scales possible with a probe mission would contain valuable information about the star formation history.

One of the key ingredients in the design of a CMB experiment is the frequency coverage required to achieve the science goals. Consequently, optimizing frequency coverage in light of the new information from $Planck$ and its limitations will be one of key task of the study proposed here.
